Welcome to One-wordGPT, a website powered by GPT-3.5-turbo that gives one-word responses to your questions. Visit [www.onewordgpt.app](https://www.onewordgpt.app) to try it out!

## About

One-wordGPT is a fun, interactive web app that uses OpenAI's powerful language model, GPT-3.5-turbo. With One-wordGPT, you can ask any question and the AI model will respond with a single word. If one word sounds like too few, you can select the title (which doubles as a dropdown menu) to make it respond in two - or even three - words! 

## Usage

Using One-wordGPT is simple:

1. Visit [www.onewordgpt.app](https://www.onewordgpt.app) in your web browser.
2. Type your question in the input field.
3. Press Enter or click the "Send" button.
4. GPT-3.5-turbo will generate a one-word response based on your question.
5. If you'd like to change the number of words, click on the title!

Please note that while the responses can be entertaining and thought-provoking, they are, at the end of the day, generated by AI and should not be taken as the gospel truth.

## Technologies Used

One-wordGPT is built using the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API
